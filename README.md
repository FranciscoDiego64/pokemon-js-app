Pokemon JS App

This small web application has been developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

Besides vanilla JavaScript some additional libraries have been applied like jQuery and Bootstrap.

The pokemon information is fetched from the Poke API (https://pokeapi.co/)
